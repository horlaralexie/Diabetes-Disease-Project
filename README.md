Diabetes Prediction Project
Project Overview
This project aims to predict the likelihood of diabetes in individuals based on various health metrics such as age, BMI, HbA1c level, blood glucose levels, and more. The dataset is highly imbalanced, with the target variable (diabetes) having more instances of class 0 (non-diabetic) than class 1 (diabetic). The goal is to develop a machine learning model that can accurately predict the presence of diabetes, with a particular emphasis on improving recall for the minority class (diabetes positive).

Methodology
The project follows the CRISP-DM (Cross-Industry Standard Process for Data Mining) methodology, which is widely used for data science and machine learning projects. The stages include:

Business Understanding: The goal of the project is to predict diabetes status, focusing on minimizing false negatives and maximizing recall for the minority class.

Data Understanding: I gathered and explored the dataset, which contains health-related attributes like age, gender, BMI, HbA1c, blood glucose level, and more. The target variable is imbalanced, making it crucial to apply techniques like SMOTE for balancing the dataset.


Data Preparation: This stage involved several key steps:
 Data cleaning to handle missing or inconsistent values.
Renaming columns for clarity.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand the distributions and relationships of features.
Univariate, Bivariate, and Multivariate analyses to explore the data in more depth.
Modeling: Multiple machine learning models were trained and evaluated. These included Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, K-Nearest Neighbors, and Gradient Boosting.

I used SMOTE for oversampling the minority class and balancing the dataset.
Models were evaluated based on several metrics, with a particular focus on recall to reduce false negatives.
Evaluation: The models were evaluated using various metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC AUC. The performance of each model was compared, and the results were visualized using confusion matrices and classification reports.

Deployment: After finalizing the best model, the results were documented and prepared for deployment.

Data Preprocessing and Analysis
Throughout the project, I performed the following analyses and transformations:

Data Cleaning: Handled missing values and duplicates.
Feature Engineering: Renamed columns like "bmi" to "body_mass_index" and "HbA1c_level" to "glycated_haemoglobin" for better clarity.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
Univariate analysis of individual features.
Bivariate and multivariate analysis to understand relationships between features.
Data Preprocessing for Machine Learning:
Used SMOTE for handling the class imbalance.
Scaled features where necessary to improve model performance.

Challenges Faced:
Imbalanced Target Variable: The diabetes dataset was highly imbalanced, with far more instances of non-diabetic individuals than diabetic individuals. To address this, I applied SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique) to balance the dataset before training models.

Model Performance: 
While accuracy was high for many models, the focus was on improving recall for the minority class. Some models, like Logistic Regression, had high recall but low precision, leading to more false positives. Balancing these metrics was crucial.

Computational Time: 
Some models, like Gradient Boosting and Random Forest, took longer to train due to their complexity. However, these models offered better overall performance in terms of both precision and recall.

Conclusion
This project provided valuable insights into the prediction of diabetes, with a focus on improving the recall of the minority class. By following the CRISP-DM methodology, I was able to systematically approach the problem, apply data preprocessing techniques, train various models, and evaluate them based on key metrics. The final models offer a solid foundation for predicting diabetes while minimizing false negatives, crucial for the healthcare domain.
